# To-Do-App

✅ A simple To-Do App: 
 
- A simple To-Do app built with HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JS, Node.js & express with terrible UI 🙃. 


🕴️ Why did I built it?

- The purpose was to practice back-end code and to manipulate the DOM with JS.
- To get a hands-on experience with Tailwind.
- To create my first server-side application on my own (which is totaly not needed for this kind simple application).
